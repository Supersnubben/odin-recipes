    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p> For a baked potato with the crispiest skin and a light and fluffy      <br>
        interior, don’t turn on the oven. Use the air fryer instead! Air        <br>
        fryer baked potatoes take less time and energy to cook.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium to medium-large russet potatoes (about 10 ounces each) </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, divided </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more for serving </li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, unsalted butter, shredded sharp cheddar,
             sour cream, and/or scallions, for serving (as desired)
        </li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 390°F if your air fryer requires preheating. <br>
            If your air fryer has multiple settings, use the “air fry” setting.   <br>
            Wash and scrub the potatoes and pat them dry with a towel. Poke each    <br>
            potato all around about 16 times with a fork. Rub each potato with     <br>
            3/4 teaspoon olive oil and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt.
        </li><br>
        <li> Place the potatoes into the basket of the air fryer, leaving about 1   <br>
             inch between each potato. Return the basket to the fryer and cook at   <br>
             390°F until the potatoes are fork tender and the skin is golden brown  <br>
             and crisp, 40 to 50 minutes, flipping each potato halfway through      <br>
             cooking.             
        </li>
        <li>Bring an inch of water in a saucepan to a boil. Place the beans in  <br>
            a steamer basket in the saucepan. Cover and cook until tender, about <br>
            10 to 15 minutes. Check for doneness after about 8 minutes or so.   <br>
            If a fork easily goes through them, they're done.                       
        </li><br>
        <li>Remove beans from pan and place them into a serving bowl. Use a     <br>
            strainer to drizzle the mint-infused olive oil over the beans. 
        </li><br>
        <li> Sprinkle salt over the beans to taste. Chop up a few more mint     <br>
            leaves to add as garnish.
    </ol>
