    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p> Every weekend during the summer, if we are lucky, there will be a   <br>
        good supply of wax beans at the farmers market.These golden yellow  <br>
        (and sometimes purple) versions of green beans are harvested young, <br>
        and are sweet and tender.Here is a simple way to prepare them,      <br>
        with the subtle flavor of a mint infusion. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces wax beans </li>
        <li>Several mint leaves </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> A little bit ahead of time, crush a few mint leaves (reserve       <br>
            some for garnish) with a mortar and pestle. Put the crushed mint    <br>
            leaves into a small jar and add a couple tablespoons of high        <br>
            quality olive oil to cover.Let sit for at least an hour if you can. <br>
            The longer the mint is in the olive oil, the better the infusion. 
        </li><br>
        <li>Prepare the beans by cutting off and discarding the tips and ends.  <br>
            Snap the beans in half, if necessary, to have pieces about 2 inches <br>
            in length.              
        </li>
        <li>Bring an inch of water in a saucepan to a boil. Place the beans in  <br>
            a steamer basket in the saucepan. Cover and cook until tender, about <br>
            10 to 15 minutes. Check for doneness after about 8 minutes or so.   <br>
            If a fork easily goes through them, they're done.                       
        </li><br>
        <li>Remove beans from pan and place them into a serving bowl. Use a     <br>
            strainer to drizzle the mint-infused olive oil over the beans. 
        </li><br>
        <li> Sprinkle salt over the beans to taste. Chop up a few more mint     <br>
            leaves to add as garnish.
    </ol>
