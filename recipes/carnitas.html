    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Carnitas are originally from Michoacán, Mexico. Pork shoulder or butt<br>
        is cut into smaller bite-sized pieces, hence the charming name:     <br>
        “little meats.” It’s then cooked submerged in hot lard, a confit-like <br> 
        cooking process that yields pork that is deliciously tender on the <br>
        inside and beautifully crisp on the outside. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Carnitas are usually served with warm corn tortillas to make one of <br>
        the most iconic and classic tacos in Mexico. You get the succulent <br>
        taste of pure pork—salty, crispy, and perfect in every way. <br>

        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup orange juice </li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark beer</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>3 cups fresh cilantro, leaves and stems, roughly chopped, <br>

    <h3>Method:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C.</li><br>
        <li>With a sharp knife, trim some of the excess fat away from the pork and  <br>
            discard, leaving some behind to flavor the carnitas while cooking.      <br>
            Cut the meat into roughly 1-inch cubes. Place the pork into a 9x13 or   <br>
            similarly sized large baking dish and season with the salt, pepper,     <br>
            and cumin.Pork Shoulder Cubes on a Cutting Board for Carnitas Recipe    <br>

        <li>Peel and slice one of the onions in half, then slice into half moons.   <br>
            Scatter the slices of onion on the meat and drizzle the olive oil on    <br>
            top.Pour in the orange juice and beer. Add a bay leaf and 1 cup of the  <br>
            chopped cilantro. Stir the ingredients together and cover the dish      <br>

        </li><br>
        <li>Place the baking dish in the oven and cook until the pork is fork-      <br>
            tender, 2 1/2 hours. Remove the baking dish from the oven and remove    <br>
            the foil.Use 2 forks to lightly shred the carnitas. You should still    <br>

        </li><br>
        <li>Turn the oven temperature up to 400°F/200°F. Once preheated, place the  <br>
            uncovered baking dish back into the oven. Bake until most of the liquid <br>
            has absorbed and the edges are crisp, stirring halfway through, about   <br>
            40 minutes.                                                     
        </li><br>
        <li>While the carnitas finish cooking, finely dice the remaining onion and  <br> 
            cilantro and place them in separate bowls. Cut the limes into wedges and <br>
            add to another small bowl. Warm up the corn tortillas in a hot pan for  <br>
            a couple of minutes on each side. Place them into a tortillero or bread <br>
            basket or wrap them in a tea towel to keep them warm.
        </li><br>
        <li>Once the pork is ready, transfer it to a platter. Bring the carnitas to <br>
            the table with the diced onion, cilantro, limes, warm corn tortillas, and <br>
            salsa. Let your family or guests prepare their own tacos using the      <br>
            carnitas, tortillas, and toppings. Store leftovers in an airtight container <br>
            in the fridge for up to 3 days.
